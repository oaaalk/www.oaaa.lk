  The Old Anandians' Astronomical Association (OAAA) is a distinguished organization of alumni from Ananda College, Colombo, Sri Lanka, united by our shared passion for astronomy and space science.
  Founded in 2018 to bridge the gap between professional astronomical knowledge and public education, OAAA serves as a beacon for scientific outreach in Sri Lanka. Our members include both amateur and professional astronomers, educators, and science communicators who are dedicated to promoting astronomy as both a science and a hobby. Through our deep connection to Ananda College's rich scientific heritage, we continue to inspire current students and the broader community to explore the wonders of the universe.

  ## Ananda College - A Legacy of Excellence

  Ananda College, established in 1886, stands as one of Sri Lanka's premier educational institutions. Founded by the Buddhist Theosophical Society led by Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, the college was named after the Buddha's faithful attendant, Ananda Thero.
  Throughout its history, Ananda College has been at the forefront of science education in Sri Lanka. The college's distinctive architecture, featuring its iconic clock tower and historic science laboratories, has witnessed generations of students discovering their passion for scientific exploration.

  ## The Anandian Astronomical Association (AAA)

  The Anandian Astronomical Association (AAA) was established in the early 1990s as a student society within Ananda College. It has served as the foundation for astronomical education and exploration among students, organizing:

  - Regular stargazing sessions using the college's telescopes
  - Educational workshops and seminars
  - Participation in national and international astronomy competitions
  - Annual astronomy camps and field trips
  - Publication of astronomy-related articles and research papers

  The AAA has been instrumental in fostering a love for astronomy among students, many of whom have gone on to pursue careers in astronomy, astrophysics, and related fields.
