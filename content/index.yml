  description: |
    The Old Anandians' Astronomical Association (OAAA) unites alumni of Ananda College, Colombo, who share a love for astronomy. We build on the legacy of Ananda College (founded 1886) and the Anandian Astronomical Association (AAA, founded early 1990s), inspiring new generations to reach for the stars. OAAA was founded in 2018 and became an affiliate of the Ananda College Old Boys' Association in 2025.
