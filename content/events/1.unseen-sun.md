description: "Unseen Sun is a public outreach event by OAAA, inviting you to
  safely observe the Sun like never before. You see the Sun every day — but
  through our specially equipped solar telescopes, you’ll witness its hidden
  side: sunspots, solar flares, and the powerful forces constantly shaping its
  surface. This is a rare opportunity to experience the dynamic, living face of
  our star — safely, up close, and in real time."
