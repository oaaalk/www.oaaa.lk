overview: |
  The Gamen Gamata (Village to Village) Astronomy Project represents OAAA's most ambitious community outreach initiative, designed to address the educational disparity between urban and rural communities in Sri Lanka. This transformative program brings astronomy education directly to villages and remote areas that typically lack access to scientific resources and expert instruction.

  Since its launch in 2023, the project has successfully reached over 50 rural communities across Sri Lanka, engaging more than 500 participants from diverse backgrounds and age groups. The initiative utilizes mobile observatory units, portable telescopes, and culturally appropriate educational materials to make astronomy accessible to all Sri Lankans, regardless of their geographic location or economic circumstances.

mission: |
  Our mission is to democratize astronomy education by eliminating geographical and economic barriers to scientific learning. We believe that every Sri Lankan, regardless of where they live, deserves the opportunity to explore the wonders of the universe and develop scientific literacy that can enhance their understanding of the world around them.

success_stories: |
  The Gamen Gamata project has generated numerous inspiring success stories:

  - In Anuradhapura district, a traditional farming community now uses astronomical knowledge to optimize their planting schedules based on lunar cycles and seasonal star positions.

  - A group of young people in Ratnapura established a community astronomy club that now regularly organizes stargazing events and maintains a small telescope library.

  - Traditional knowledge keepers in the Northern Province have collaborated with our team to document ancient Tamil astronomical practices and star names.

  - Several participants have pursued further education in science after being inspired by the program, with two students now studying physics at university level.
