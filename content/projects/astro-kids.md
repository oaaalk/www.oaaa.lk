overview: |
  Astro Kids represents OAAA's flagship youth education program, specifically designed to introduce young minds to the wonders of astronomy through engaging, hands-on experiences. Building on Ananda College's tradition of excellence in science education, this comprehensive program has successfully engaged over 500 young learners across Sri Lanka since its inception in 2022.

  The program recognizes that children are naturally curious about space and the universe, and channels this curiosity into structured learning experiences that combine scientific education with fun, interactive activities. Participants gain not only astronomical knowledge but also develop critical thinking skills, scientific methodology understanding, and a lifelong appreciation for learning and discovery.

program_philosophy: |
  Our approach to youth astronomy education is built on several key principles:

  - **Learn by Doing**: Hands-on experiences with real telescopes and astronomical instruments
