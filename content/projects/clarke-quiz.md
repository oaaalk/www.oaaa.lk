overview: |
  The Arthur C. Clarke Quiz Competition stands as a prestigious annual event that honors the legendary science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, who spent his later years in Sri Lanka and significantly contributed to science communication in the country. This comprehensive competition tests students' knowledge of astronomy, space exploration, astrophysics, and related sciences while celebrating Clarke's enduring legacy of making complex scientific concepts accessible to the general public.

  Since its inception in 2020, the competition has attracted participants from leading educational institutions across Sri Lanka, creating a platform for young minds to demonstrate their passion for space science and astronomy. The quiz covers topics ranging from basic astronomical phenomena to cutting-edge space missions, encouraging participants to stay current with the latest developments in space science and exploration.

  Sir Arthur Charles Clarke (1917-2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer, futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host who made Sri Lanka his home from 1956 until his death. Known for his groundbreaking science fiction novels and his role in conceptualizing geostationary satellites, Clarke embodied the perfect blend of scientific rigor and imaginative storytelling.

  His contributions to Sri Lanka include:
  - Establishing the Arthur C. Clarke Centre for Modern Technologies
  - Promoting science education and technological advancement
  - Inspiring generations of Sri Lankan scientists and engineers
  - Advocating for the peaceful uses of space technology
  - Supporting marine archaeology and underwater exploration around Sri Lanka

  Clarke's famous "Three Laws" continue to inspire scientific thinking:
  1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
  2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
  3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
