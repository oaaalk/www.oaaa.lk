overview: |
  The Unseen Sun project represents a groundbreaking initiative in solar astronomy education, bringing together the expertise of both current and former students of Ananda College. This unique collaboration between the Anandian Astronomical Association (AAA) and the Old Anandian Astronomical Association (OAAA) exemplifies our commitment to bridging generational knowledge and fostering scientific excellence.

  Running from July 7-11, 2025, at Ananda College's historic Sathmahala Premises, this project is an integral component of the comprehensive 'Sakwala25' program. The initiative provides students with unprecedented opportunities to safely observe and study solar phenomena, including solar flares, sunspots, and solar prominences using state-of-the-art solar telescopes and specialized filters.

objectives:
  - title: "Safe Solar Observation Education"
    description: "Teach students proper techniques and safety protocols for solar observation using specialized equipment and filters."

  - title: "Scientific Methodology Training"
    description: "Introduce participants to systematic observation techniques, data recording, and scientific analysis methods."

  - title: "Solar Phenomena Understanding"
    description: "Provide comprehensive education about solar structures, solar cycles, and space weather impacts on Earth."

  - title: "Heritage Preservation"
    description: "Honor Ananda College's rich scientific heritage dating back to 1886 while inspiring future generations of astronomers."

safety_measures: |
  Safety is our paramount concern in all solar observation activities. All participants receive comprehensive safety training before handling any equipment. We use only certified solar filters and telescopes specifically designed for solar observation. Never attempt to look at the Sun through unfiltered telescopes or cameras. All observation sessions are supervised by experienced astronomers and safety officers.

educational_impact: |
  This project builds upon OAAA's mission of making astronomy accessible while honoring Ananda College's rich scientific heritage. By providing hands-on solar observation experiences, we inspire the next generation of astronomers and foster scientific curiosity. The project emphasizes critical thinking, systematic observation, and collaborative learning.

  Participants gain valuable experience in scientific methodology, astronomy instrumentation, and data analysis. Many students who participate in such programs continue their astronomical interests through secondary education and beyond, contributing to Sri Lanka's growing community of amateur and professional astronomers.

collaboration: |
  The Unseen Sun project exemplifies the power of intergenerational collaboration in science education. The partnership between AAA and OAAA brings together the enthusiasm of current students with the experience and resources of alumni, creating a unique learning environment that benefits all participants.

  This collaboration model has proven successful in previous OAAA initiatives and demonstrates our commitment to supporting the Anandian astronomical community across all generations.

registration: |
  The program is primarily designed for Ananda College students, with opportunities for broader community participation. Registration includes all necessary materials, safety equipment, and certification upon completion.

  For registration and more information, please contact the Anandian Astronomical Association through the college or reach out to OAAA through our official channels.

future_plans: |
  The success of the Unseen Sun project will inform future solar observation programs and potentially lead to the establishment of a permanent solar observation facility at Ananda College. We envision expanding this program to include advanced solar research projects and international collaborations in solar astronomy education.
