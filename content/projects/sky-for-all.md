# Sky For All

ky for All – සැමට අහස is an ongoing public outreach project in astronomy launched to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the International Astronomical Union (IAU 1919–2019). As part of the global "100 Hours of Astronomy" initiative, this project was designed to make astronomy accessible to everyone, fostering curiosity and engagement with the universe among people of all ages and backgrounds.

The project is a collaboration between the Old Anandians' Astronomical Association and the Star Party Group, uniting experienced observers, educators, and enthusiasts. One of the key milestones of the Sky for All project was a public observation program held on the 11th of January 2019, from 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at Galle Face Green, Colombo. During this event, participants had the opportunity to observe the Sun during the day and the night sky through telescopes, with guidance from astronomy educators and amateur astronomers.

With its core theme "The Sky for All – සැමට අහස", the project emphasizes inclusivity and public engagement, aiming to spark a long-term interest in astronomy and space science through accessible, community-centered activities.
