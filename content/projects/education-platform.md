overview: |
  The Astronomy Education Platform represents OAAA's commitment to leveraging modern technology for educational advancement while maintaining our core mission of making astronomy accessible to everyone. This innovative digital platform addresses the significant challenge of providing quality astronomy education to remote areas where physical access to telescopes, expert instructors, and specialized resources may be limited.

  Since its launch in 2023, the platform has attracted over 2000 active learners from across Sri Lanka, offering multilingual content in Sinhala, Tamil, and English to ensure maximum accessibility. The platform features interactive modules, virtual telescope simulations, and real-time sky exploration tools that allow students to explore celestial objects and phenomena from anywhere with an internet connection.
