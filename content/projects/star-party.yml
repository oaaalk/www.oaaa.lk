overview: |
  Star Party Sri Lanka stands as the longest-running and most prestigious inter-school astronomical observation competition in Sri Lanka, representing over two decades of excellence in astronomy education. Since its inaugural event on January 30, 2004, this flagship competition has been held annually at the University of Peradeniya, bringing together the brightest young astronomical minds from across the nation.

  This remarkable initiative is jointly organized by the Anandian Astronomical Association and the Astronomical Society of Mahamaya Girls' College, representing a collaborative effort that has fundamentally shaped Sri Lankan amateur astronomy. The competition serves as both a celebration of student achievement and a launching pad for future astronomers, astrophysicists, and space scientists.

  Star Party has become the cornerstone of Sri Lanka's astronomical education calendar, fostering scientific excellence and inspiring countless students to pursue careers in astronomy and related fields. The event's motto "Ad Astra Per Aspera" (Through Hardships to the Stars) embodies the dedication and perseverance required to excel in astronomical studies.

historical_significance: |
  The establishment of Star Party Sri Lanka in 2004 marked a watershed moment for astronomy education in the country. Created during a period when amateur astronomy was still developing in Sri Lanka, the competition provided a much-needed platform for students to showcase their astronomical knowledge and observation skills.

  Over its 21-year history, Star Party has:
  - Introduced thousands of students to serious astronomical observation
  - Established standardized practices for astronomy education in schools
  - Created a network of astronomy-enthusiastic educators across the country
  - Produced numerous professional astronomers and scientists
  - Influenced national science education policy

  The competition has evolved from a modest gathering of astronomy enthusiasts to a nationally recognized event that attracts participants from all provinces of Sri Lanka.
